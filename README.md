Currently there are russian comments and code is a quite messy overall.
Sorry for that, I became to production codding after this project.
Anyway to check how it works, yo can unpack source images from:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16gZBusm2KPSwY6jQkUMVGn0JyihxVFvv/view?usp=sharing
to Train1 folder in the repo root.Then run Demo.m
It would take a few minute.

Thats it
